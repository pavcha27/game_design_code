# Welcome to my practice page!
My name is Pavan Chaudhari, a data scientist at Enact Mortgage Insurance. I'm using this repo to practice programming small games in pygame to try and start learning game dev.

# Pygame
[Pygame] is a game dev module in Python built on the SDL library. This gives it some nice capabilities with the familiarity of Python (i.e., simple clean code) while having the power of great rendering tools. I was recommended to start here, before my journey into Godot.

# My games
So far I have developed the following games:

1. **Fruit Collector**: a simple game where you just move around and collect fruit. I was learning how to take in keystrokes and check image collision/hit detection here. Additionally, I learned how to wait some time before re-rendering the fruit.
